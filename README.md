I had never used React-Saga, so I got to learn about it and most of my time was spent learning about it.
## I deployed this application using Netlify.

Also, when I was implementing pagination for the coins, I chose to let it start with the first 50 coins , when the next page button is hit the pageNumber is increased which brings about the next 50 coins...But when the pageNumber becomes>3 I chose to show the first 50 coins and it is kept stuck there.
